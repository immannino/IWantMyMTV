### ISSUES
- Issue: Artist or Songs with encodable chars.
    - Caching user playlists + playlist tracks so that we don't have to make api calls every single time. 
        - Need to rethink the logic and simplify passing around and storying cache of playlists. 
        - Logic should follow: 
            - Check State
            - If state is good, then return
            - if state is not good, make a service request
            - Always update state
        - Draw out pattern on paper
    - Update designs
